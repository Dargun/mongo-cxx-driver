      <description>Additional Options for Integrators In the event that you are building the BSON C++ library and/or the C++ driver to embed with other components and you wish to avoid the potential for collision with components installed from a standard build or from a distribution package manager, you can make use of the BSONCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME and MONGOCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME options to cmake.
cmake .. \  -DBSONCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME=custom_bsoncxx \  -DMONGOCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME=custom_mongocxx The above command would produce libraries named libcustom_bsoncxx.</description>
